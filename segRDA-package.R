#' segRDA: An R package for performing piecewise redundancy analysis
#'
#'The package segRDA is straightforward through three steps: (1) data ordering, (2) breakpoints detection through split-moving-window analysis (SMW) and (3) piecewise redundancy analysis (pwRDA).
#'
#'The package includes a total of 7 functions: (1) \code{\link{OrdData}}: designed to prepare the target data; (2)  \code{\link{SMW.test}} and  (3) \code{\link{PoolSMW}}: designed for performing SMW analyses; (4) \code{\link{BPlocation}}:  designed to locate the breakpoints along a dissimilarity profile; (5) \code{\link{pwRDA}}: designed to perform the pwRDA analysis; (6) \code{\link{Dprofile}} and (7) \code{\link{Dprofile2}} designed to plot results from SMW analysis
